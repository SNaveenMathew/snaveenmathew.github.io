## Summary

I'm a (data) scientist with 6.5 years of industry experience in machine learning R&D. I currently work on fundamental scientific problems, delivering insights from experimental data. I'm deeply interested in mathematical foundations of machine  learning and deep learning. I'm also interested in creating data pipelines and automatic machine learning (including unsupervised learning, which is often ignored in popular AutoML frameworks). In the past I worked with client delivery teams to create automated pipelines for supervised and unsupervised learning ([details](#productsolution-development)).

## Product/Solution Development

Short presentations on my R&D work in industry can be found below:

## Course Work

To know more about my course work and to get a copy of my personal course notes (LaTeX), please visit [this page](courses.md). Important things to note:

- The R Markdown scripts can be compiled to generate PDF outputs. I take extra care not to upload PDF files to my course repository. Please DO NOT contact me for assistance on compilation to PDF
- Please DO NOT contact me for feedback on courses or professors. Most importantly, please DO NOT contact me for assignments. I will not entertain any violation of [honor code](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/honor-code) of UIUC before
- Please DO NOT contact me for the actual slides used in courses. If you are interested in the program please visit the [Statistics department website](https://stat.illinois.edu)

## Knowledge Sharing

- I share my knowledge through [my blog](https://medium.com/@snaveenmathew/) on Medium.com. My main focus is on the mathematical and statistical fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning. I also share my practical experience by explaining how mathematics helps in solving real-life problems. I update links to my blog posts on [this page](blog.md)
- I recently started putting together all my blogs in the form of a loosely ordered [book](https://snaveenmathew.github.io/ml_book/). Most of the pages will be empty except the chapter on [Generalized Linear Models / Linear Regression](https://snaveenmathew.github.io/ml_book/linear_regression.html)
