# Naveen Mathew Nathan S.

## Summary

I'm an aspiring data scientist with 3.5 years of industry experience in data science R&D. I worked in service oriented settings and in product teams that delivered insights from data. I'm deeply interested in pipelining and automation of machine learning (supervised and unsupervised). In the past I worked with delivery teams to create automated pipelines for supervised and unsupervised learning ([details](#productsolution-development)).

## Product/Solution Development {#product_solution}

## Knowledge Sharing

I share my knowledge through [my blog](https://medium.com/@pg13s_nathan/) on Medium.com. My main focus is on the basic mathematical and statistical concepts behind machine learning. I also share my practical experience by explaining how mathematics helps in solving real-life problems.
