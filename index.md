## Summary

I'm an aspiring data scie ntist with 3.5 years of industry experience in data science R&D. I worked as a data scientist in service oriented settings and in product teams that delivered insights from data. I'm deeply interested in pipelining and automation of machine learning. In the past I worked with delivery teams to create automated pipelines for supervised and unsupervised learning.

Short presentations on my R&D work in industry can be found below:

- [Automated pipeline for binary classification](supervised_slides.html)
- [Automated pipeline for clustering and basket anlaysis](unsupervised_slides.html)
- Pipeline for text understanding and predictive modeling. [[View Presentation](text_classification.html)] [[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/SNaveenMathew/TextMining)]

I also share my knowledge through [my blog](https://medium.com/@pg13s_nathan/) on Medium.com. My main focus is on the basic mathematical and statistical concepts behind machine learning. I also share my practical experience by explaining how mathematics helps in solving real-life problems.
